# Video Job Applications and Video Interviews

This PHP (and HTML5/JS) application is a sample reference implementation showing how to utilize the Kaltura Media Services and Experience Components to build a video recruiting app where job applicants can submit a 5min introduction video (and edit it) as part of their job application and then schedule and participate in an embedded video meeting with the recruiting interviewer.
